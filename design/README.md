# Design strategy
Basically start with an Evennia "talker" style mud. Implement the minimum functions necessary to allow players to interact with eachother and try to achieve intimacy or eunoia.

# Control Communication

## Disable default commands that allow free form communication.

[_] all channels
[_] say
[_] whisper
[_] pose

## Implement Communication commands
* Attitudes
* Posture
* Signals
* Intimate conversation

# Give the game some objectives
The objective should be to acheive intimacy with other players.

# Determine the obstacles
What if anything prevents the players from instantly acheiving intimacy

# Create trade-off, touch choices
What does a player have to sacrifice to acheive the objective. Why is that a challenge.

# Idea: 
Intimacy is a limited resource. Time is limited too. All bodies die at a certain time. 

# Matchmaking, fitness and Eunoia.
Final score is based on acheiving the best possible match. Finding the right partner. 
Matchmakine score is subjective/objective

# Itchbots
So at the lowest levels of intimacy bots could easily masquerade as players. They will try to attract players and waste their time.
Players can compete with eachother and with the bots for attention, trying to get the best mates. Bots also 'poison the well' so to speak by reducing trust over all.
Players have to act out sometimes to distinguish themselves from bots.

# Matching Compatiblity
Compatibility traits include objective fitness scores as well as subjective complimentariness and also meta-game attributes like play styles, geo-region, timezone, language etc.

# Distribution and testing
This game will certainly need some critical mass of players to actually find out if it works
